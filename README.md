# SBA 308: JavaScript Fundamentals

## Purpose

SBA Project for Per Scholas. Created a method to take courseInfo, AssingmentGroup, and LearnerSubmission objects and output the grade average and each assignment score percentages for each student like so:

```
[
    {
        id: ###,
    avg: ##,
    assignment #: 0.##,
    assignment #: 0.##}
    ,
    {
        id: ###,
    avg: ##,
    assignment #: 0.##,
    assignment #: 0.##
    }
];
```

## Objectives

- Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
- Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
- Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
- Develop functions to create reusable code.
- Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
- Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.
